let's take a step back and let me explain the functionality im thinking of. then let's make a plan. 

In default retracted mode (non-edit): 
- rows are slimmer and in a collapsed state.
- if the there are no pictures or notes, then the row isn't expandable.
- [icon] [label] - [amount] on left. 
- [time] on right. 
- if there's notes or photos, then there's also a down chevron to the right of time
- if expanded, the row opens like an accordion, pushing other items down and displays the cotnents
- more than one row can be opened at once
- opened rows reset when naving away and back or when changing the filter.

when the timeline is in edit mode: 
- all rows become editable in 2 ways: 
1. you can tap and hold to drag and drop them on the timeline, like now no changes
2. each row also has the pen icon where the chevron would be on the right. if you tap the pen it opens @components/halfsheets/TTFeedDetailSheet.js or @components/halfsheets/TTSleepDetailSheet.js and you can edit the info. 
- rows cannot be expanded from their collapsed default state in edit mode

for future scheduled items
- i want to keep the styling exactly the same as what is currently in the timeline
- they have no contents so cannot be expanded
- only their time can be edited in edit mode via drag and drop

is this a good plan? am i missing anything?
